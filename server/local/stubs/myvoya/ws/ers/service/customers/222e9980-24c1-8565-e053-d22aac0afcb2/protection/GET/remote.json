In order to provide an estimate, your earnings history is approximated using your current age, retirement age, annual                \t\t\t\t\t\tsalary, and annual salary increase. Under most circumstances, Social Security retirement benefits cannot be collected prior to age 62. For                \t\t\t\t\t\tillustrative purposes, if your stated retirement age is less than age 62, benefit estimates that would be available starting at age 62 are                \t\t\t\t\t\tdisplayed.

Income estimates assume you make a lump sum purchase of a single life immediate annuity\t\t\t\t\t\t                at retirement which would pay you a level income amount each month as long as you live. Using this annuity assumption allows us to translate\t\t\t\t\t\t                your projected retirement portfolio into terms that are similar to other retirement income sources like Social Security or any pension\t\t\t\t\t\t                benefits. The estimated income amount shown is the income you would receive at retirement in terms of today's dollars. Note that inflation will\t\t\t\t\t\t                erode your spending power over time. The projected amount of the annuity income payment is based on the combination of the Society of\t\t\t\t\t\t                Actuaries' Annuity 2000 Basic Mortality Table and recent Immediate Annuity interest rates from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)\t\t\t\t\t\t                (<a href=\"http://www.pbgc.gov/prac/interest/ida.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pbgc.gov/prac/interest/ida.html</a><em></em>), a federal\t\t\t\t\t\t                agency created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Please keep in mind that this approach to generating your income\t\t\t\t\t\t                estimate does not constitute a recommendation to purchase an annuity at retirement.
